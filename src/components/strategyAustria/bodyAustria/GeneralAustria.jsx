        When you draw Austria in a game your first thought should be: "How can I
        survive the first two or three years of this game?" Sometimes Austria
        doesn't last two or three turns let alone two or three years, so simple
        survival should be the first order of business.
      </p>
      <p>
        For obvious reasons, Austria is the easiest country to eliminate. She is
        surrounded at the start of the game, and sitting atop the area of the
        board with the densest concentration of supply centers, the Balkans.
        Russia and Turkey both covet this region, and most Italian players will
        make the mistake of stabbing you to get a piece of the action when you
        start to falter. So the Austrian position is a precarious one. You are
        going to be at the center of the action from the start of the game, and
        you are going to have to play your tail off to make something happen for
        your country. Austria, as much as any country on the board, requires a
        great deal of hard work. It takes a GOOD player to win with Austria. It
        is going to take a tremendous diplomatic effort. Position and tactics
        mean less with Austria than with most countries. Everything hinges on
        whether or not you can make the right friends at the right moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you slip up, even a little bit--kiss your butt goodbye because some
        hotshot Turkey or Russian is going to gobble you up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said all that, understand that if you can orchestrate a victory
        or two, your chances of winning the game zoom way up. As mentioned,
        Austria is sitting right on top of the Balkans, a powerful base to draw
        upon for a mid-game victory drive.
