      <p>
        Germany is rarely discussed when talking about Austria, which I think is
        a big mistake. 99 percent of the diplomacy players realize that Germany
        and Austria shouldn't be fighting each other. But that really isn't
        going far enough. Austria and Germany need to work together for their
        mutual benefit. Simply staying out of each other's hair isn't
        enough--you might accidentally screw each up. So your first order of
        affairs is to get on good terms with the German. He won't be thinking of
        attacking you--but he might not be thinking of you at all, which isn't
        much better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so now you've got Germany seeing the light...he should keep you
        abreast of any pertinent information, and anything that threatens you is
        a blow to him. Usually, this means encouraging him to open with fleet
        Kiel to Denmark. You want Kiel to move to Den in order to bounce Russia
        out of Sweden if need be. I have always been able to convince Germany of
        how vital I am to his survival. And don't forget--he is vital to you,
        although less so--just don't let the Russian get any ground in Germany.
        This shouldn't be a problem since you are convincing the Russian to go
        along with you in an attack on the Sultan.

      <p className="bodyHeadings">Russia</p>
      <p>
        Now we come to the key for Austria. In the east, Russia-Austria-Turkey
        form a tense triangle. You need to get one of them on your side against
        the other. Getting Russia on your side against Turkey should be a little
        easier than getting Turkey to come to your side against Russia. Dividing
        up the Balkans and Turkey with Russia is a real headache, but things
        rarely get that far before open war breaks out between you two. If you
        can, negotiate hard for Bulgaria. Offer Russia all of Turkey in exchange
        for Bulgaria--Because if you get it, you'll be able to really stab the
        Russian in Rumania and then shoot for Sevastopol. But timing is
        important--if you stab russia too soon, he and a still breathing Turkey
        will wipe you out. If you stab too late, he might have the units built
        to fend you off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Offer Russia things like a de-militarized Turkey once the alliance is
        over. Make all your offers around believable--but keep in mind the real
        object: Russia is to be the rock with which you bludgeon Turkey. Don't
        get tripped up by how well things may go. You will have gained little by
        actually splitting up the south with Russia--what is to be gained is a
        weak and ineffective Turkey and a greatly committed Russia overextending
        himself to get at the straits.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think Russia is the best chance Austria has to take out the Turk
        (we'll get to Italy later) and really explode. An alliance with Russia
        will give you a great deal of Security and will allow you to control the
        Balkans better than a pact with the Turk will.
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Turkey</p>
      <p>
        Everything said about Russia also applies in many ways to Turkey. Your
        principle motive for alliance here is to give yourself some security and
        to beat Russia senseless while waiting for the opportunity to back-stab
        your partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I said, I think it is harder to swing this alliance. So many people
        assume (rightly, in general) that Austria and Turkey are mortal enemies
        that getting together is hard to do. But it can be done, and is done all
        the time. But like Russia, your alliance here is a short-term one.
        Always be looking for the right moment, when you can safely and
        effectively knock out the Turk. Usually, this will be when the Turk has
        captured Sevastopol (hopefully during a spring turn). This is a good
        time to stab him. By taking a center from him now you deny him the Sev.
        build, Russia will fight to take it back, further weakening him, and the
        unit is far from home (unless he convoyed an army there). As a
        benchmark, look for his capture of Sevastopol to be the signal to switch
        sides and hit him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Turkish alliance will again, be hard to divide in terms of centers.
        You both will want to have Greece, for instance. I would not advise
        giving Greece to Turkey. Saying you will give it to him--that's another
        story. Better to offer him Rumania and Sevastopol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep your eye on what Turkey builds--encourage him to build fleets and
        power out into the Med after Italy. You will head North, you assure him,
        once you two have knocked out Russia and given St. Pete to some friendly
        western power. Whatever tactic you use--the goal is to get Turkish units
        into the water, where they are no threat to you and of no use to the
        Turk in defending himself from you. (with regards to Russia as
        well--although, if you can get the russian to build up a bunch of navies
        in the south he or she is probably your little brother or your mom and
        in that case you should roll no matter what you do.)
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Italy</p>
      <p>
        You must offer Italy a neutrality pact. I'm not even going to go into
        attacks of Italy because I think they are as foolish as attacks on
        Germany. If you turn your back on turkey and russia you will get
        crushed. Pulling it off would require utterly incompetent Russia and
        Turkish players.
      </p>
      <p>
        But keeping Italy from attacking YOU is harder. You must show him that
        to attack you is folly. You have one secret weapon in this debate: You
        are right. Italian openings against Austria invariably end up with
        Turkey and Russia rolling all over everyone, including Italy. Make sure
        that Italy realizes you are the only thing between him and total
        destruction at the hands of Turkey and Russia. Having accomplished this,
        try to get him to outright attack Turkey in a Lepanto. If the R-T
        alliance forms, he will need to do this for sheer self defense. If not,
        sell him on the riches of Turkey--when he finally gets there you will be
        strong enough to muscle him out of there. But be careful that the
        Italian doesn't link up with Russia after Turkey is reduced. This is the
        greatest danger to you in going to bed with the Italian. So make sure
        Russia and Italy don't communicate too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        My preferred Austrian strategy is to get everyone going after the Turk.
        Then I can stab the Russian without really saving Turkey, and then
        conquer my grateful Turkish friend, denying italy his hard-fought gains.
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Russia and Turkey</p>
      <p>
        It's clear what you have to do with these two. Some people concentrate
        on getting Russia and Turkey to go to war with each other. This is fine,
        but you won't be able to do it without getting involved in the fight
        yourself. If you simply try to instigate a war with them you will be
        found out and shown to be kind of weak. Choose one to ally with against
        the other--then it's a matter of timing--when do you stab your ally? Do
        it when the original foe is weak, of course and when it looks as though
        another power might be able to help you (England against Russia for
        example, or Italy against Turkey). But be ready to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated at the start, Austria must first concern herself with
        survival. So don't just throw in with Russia or Turkey and hope for the
        best. They will be trying to ally and attack you in many cases. Analyze
        their mailings to you carefully, and don't be afraid to be a little
        bristly at first--if they think you will be a pushover they might try
        pushing you. Remind them of your friendship with the German, and his
        promises to come to your aid (especially against Russia). Hopefully this
        will be more than just a threat--and Germany will confirm your alliance.
        Remind Turkey that Italy has been wanting to try out Lepanto for some
        time--an attack on you will only bring green fleets sailing into the
        Eastern Med. and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now here is the trick. If you do all of this won't you encourage Turkey
        and Russia to ally? Possibly, if you aren't doing much talking with the
        two of them. But if you use these threats and hints of threats with lots
        of serious talk about alliance and how there really is no future in an
        alliance with the Turk/Russian, human nature being what it is, many will
        throw in with you rather than risk a bloody nose.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a whole series of openings that seek to present as tough a
        posture as possible for Austria, called, appropriately, "Hedgehog"
        openings. The most important part of any Hedgehog is to diplomacy in a
        similar manner. It's pointless to start a game with some bristly
        tactical opening when the same could have been accomplished through
        diplomacy. So don't be afraid to be thin-skinned early on as Austria.
        You are, after all, rather thin-skinned in terms of defense early on.
