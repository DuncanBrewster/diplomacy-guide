        England has the somewhat dubious pleasure of being the lone island power
        in Diplomacy. Not only does an attack on English soil require an
        opponent to match or overcome England's starting naval power, but even a
        relatively basic attack can easily tie up three or more units. This
        large investment makes any aggressors vulnerable, and if England can
        hold their ground for just a few seasons, the cavalry will often come
        running to the rescue. Conversely, England must expend just as much
        effort to launch an effective attack. This is evidenced by England's
        only guaranteed first-year build: Nwy. In the worst-case scenario, all
        of England's starting units will be committed to this single task.
      </p>
      <p>
        England's early game will hinge on the diplomatic climate of the Western
        Triangle (consisting of itself, Germany, and France), and to a lesser
        extent the Northern Triangle (made up of England, Germany, and Russia).
        Nwy is easily guaranteed in the first year, though Bel is also
        a fairly common first year acquisition. Though landing in Scandinavia may
        seem to determine England's route to expansion, it should not forgo Nwy
        lightly. Taking control of Bel is a great bonus, but more important is
        to ensure England is on the favorable end of the 2v1 that the west often
        degenerates into. If England is offered Bel, by all means it should take
        advantage of the opportunity, but do not press so firmly as to seem
        greedy, as that is a quick way to ensure a French-German alliance
        setting sail for England immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, being content with an unprovoked capture of Nwy is
        very commonly the prudent move. England may even barter support into Bel
        to buy the friendship of either France or Germany and the added security
        of not being the odd-man-out in the west. The geography section briefly
        touched on the direct effects of allying with or against either France
        or Germany, but to make the most of either situation, England needs to
        look at the whole board.

        The route to victory in a game of Diplomacy is long and slow, and doubly
        so for a nation so far removed from the SC concentrations in central
        Europe. English victories will at the very least include their home
        centers, Scandinavia (Den, Nwy, Swe), the Lowlands (Bel, Hol), Iberia
        (Por, Spa), at least two from each of France and Germany for a total of
        14. Where the last four SCs come from will depend on in-game
        developments, and it's fairly common for England to reach into Russia as
        deep as Mos, or even as far into the Mediterranean as Tun or Nap.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important thing England must always keep in mind is reaching across
        the stalemate line by advancing past Stp, Ber, Mar, or Tun. In many
        cases, shoring up a defensive position on the far half of the board will
        take higher priority than getting the jump on the next target. Once
        England builds a lead, the window of opportunity for an 18th SC will
        become increasingly more difficult as the game progresses and the rest
        of the board bands together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Endgame tactics and stalemate positions should always be in the back of
        England's mind, either to make the last grab for victory, or to hold a
        defensive position and force a draw.
