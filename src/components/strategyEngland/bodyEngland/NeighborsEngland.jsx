      <p className="bodyHeadings">France</p>
      <p>
        To the south lies France; a strong and defensible nation who can be both
        the most dangerous foe and the most valuable ally. Eliminating France
        will give England not only the defensive benefit of France's geometry,
        but will also give England an entire side of the board to itself to
        allow focusing all its units onto one eastward-facing front. Allying
        with France will provide England with this same benefit much earlier in
        the game, though at the cost of not owning any of the 5 SCs in France's
        usual sphere of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        By allying France and attacking Germany, England should hope to control
        all of Scandinavia (Nwy, Swe, Den) as well as Hol, Kie, and Ber. This
        will ideally put England at 9 SCs and France at 7 (possibly 8, if it's
        been waging war with Italy at the same time), though Russia will not be
        content to sit idly by and watch Germany crumble in front of his eyes.
        Russia, then, can easily take Swe and Ber for himself and England will
        no longer have an advantage over his southern ally France.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tactically, a DMZ should be agreed upon in ENG, and England should
        pressure France to not build any fleets in Bre. Of any point to make a
        firm stand on, this one is crucial to England's security in an alliance
        with France.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Germany being the first target, England must ask Germany to
        bounce Russia out of Swe in the first year. This not only gives England
        some breathing room in the north, but may also draw the attention of
        Russia, distracting him from any dreams of building fleets in Stp(nc) to
        harass your waters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, England should push either or both of Austria and Turkey
        to attack Russia. Anything that will further distract Russia will assist
        in England taking the largest shares of Germany for itself, thus
        solidifying it's position as the dominant half of the alliance with
        France.
      </p>
      <p>
        If England is feeling particularly nasty (or more likely, paranoid)
        requesting Italy to move west against France will widen England's
        advantage even more. This, however, is unlikely as Italy will not find
        any easy gains in the west without help from England and/or Germany. The
        situation is quite convenient if it can be orchestrated, but is hardly
        necessary to England's success.
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Germany</p>
      <p>
        To the southeast is Germany. By virtue of Germany's central board
        position, England has little to fear from an aggressive Germany acting
        on his own, as the other nations will be eager to advance into the
        German homeland and its SC-dense surroundings. Couple this with
        Germany's difficulty in building a navy able to match England's, and it
        would seem that a one-on-one matchup between the two is entirely in
        England's favor. However, a lasting alliance with Germany will require
        England to stretch quite far in both the Russian and Mediterranean
        fronts to achieve victory; conversely, driving headlong into Germany
        will require England to defend his frontlines against opposition from
        three directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By allying Germany and attacking France, England should hope to take
        Nwy, Iberia (Por, Spa), and either two of France's SCs, or Bre and Bel,
        for a total of 8 SCs. If Germany took Bel initially, it may be hard to
        convince him to trade it away, but an English fleet in Bel is more
        convenient to defend than a German army would be. Italy, should he be
        privy to the England-German alliance, will often be happy to lend a hand
        in cracking France's defenses provided he is compensated for his
        efforts. Mar is a fair price, but if England isn't fast enough to
        Iberia, Italy's eyes may drift to Spa and move to take it for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the alliance with France, in which England attempts to tie down
        and hinder each and every one of his neighbors, he must work to provide
        security for Germany. If Russia takes an opportunity to grab Swe, Ber,
        or Mun from Germany, England's assault on France will quickly falter as
        his ally rushes home to maintain defense. A wounded France is still
        quite dangerous, and one bent on revenge may quickly recover his losses
        and strike back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Russia, then, must be persuaded to strike south against Austria or
        Turkey. He may not be pleased to surrender Swe to Germany, and if he
        cannot be reasoned with, England must reign in Germany's northern
        ambitions until after the fall of France.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of where England's allegiance was in the opening stages of
        the game, the main decision facing England in either case is the same:
        to continue the original alliance and attempt to stretch past the
        stalemate line? or to turn against England's former ally with its
        new-found strength and take the entire west for itself?
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Russia</p>
      <p>
        Russia begins far to the east, and to newer players, it would seem too
        far to warrant immediate concern. Despite Russia beginning on the
        opposite end of the board, the geography of the board edges puts it just
        a couple territories away. Usually, early negotiations between the two
        nations involves a cordial but tense agreement on how to divide
        Scandinavia favorably, though with a quiet southern front, England may
        decide to push into Stp and prepare for a strike south later in the
        game.
