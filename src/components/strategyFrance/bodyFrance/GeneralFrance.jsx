        France is the easiest country to play. While not as defensively sound as
        England or Turkey, France is able to move troops quickly through Europe
        without the burden of a long convoy chain required by Turkey or England.
        France also has better long-term survival prospects than either, since
        while England and Turkey are often forced into a corner and survive
        until midgame after a long, hopeless war, if France survives the initial
        possibility of attack from an England-Germany alliance (or, more rarely,
        an attack from Italy), they can do very well in the mid- and late-games
        (France has very high end-survival and draw records, as well as a fair
        number of wins). Iberia provides two quick and easy builds early, and
        profitable alliances can be undertaken with either England or Germany,
        or both. However, England is not suggested, since England has a better
        chance of stabbing than Germany or Italy does.
