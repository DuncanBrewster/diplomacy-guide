      <p className="bodyHeadings">England</p>
      <p>
        England is a viable ally, but France usually chooses to annex England
        first while England is vulnerable early. Giving England too much time
        reduces the chances of a French solo because England can build up an
        impenetrable wall of fleets. Because Scandinavia is easily defended by
        sea, giving England time can cost France up to seven supply centers.
        That can be very difficult to make up elsewhere, even in a game that’s
        going well. France, Germany, Italy, Iberia, Tunisia, Belgium, Holland,
        Moscow, and Warsaw only add up to sixteen centers; the final centers
        will have to come from deep in southern Europe. And all the while,
        France must defend a long border from English incursion.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, France can easily capture England’s home centers if
        France convoys an army onto Great Britain. Once in control of Great
        Britain, France is the favorite to solo. France now has the combined
        tactical might of both France and England.
      </p>
      <p>
        With just three armies, France can build a wall on its land border
        that Germany alone cannot break through. If France is not under attack
        from the south, that leaves France four fleets to fight over North
        Sea. Four fleets can be a decisive numerical advantage for France.
        Germany’s borders with Austria and Russia demand army garrisons to
        defend, which means Germany typically opts out of amassing fleets.
        Once North Sea and Norwegian Sea are secure, France has a plethora of
        options available for further expansion. Even with a dedicated
        alliance, Germany and Russia will find it difficult to prevent France
        from overrunning both players. Most French wins come from annexation
        of England and subsequent domination of the northern seas.

        England can force the Channel, but not much more. On defense, France
        can struggle to keep England from breaching the English Channel in
        Spring ’01 and Spring ’02. In Spring ’01, the better move for France
        is usually to pick up Portugal by opening to Mid-Atlantic Ocean. In
        Spring ’02, France usually only has one fleet adjacent to English
        Channel, compared to England’s two. However, without pressure from
        somewhere else, a breach of the Channel is more annoying than
        threatening to France. Furthermore, France can parry this move
        effectively by moving from Mid-Atlantic Ocean to North Atlantic Ocean
        or Irish Sea. The real threat comes from combined pressure from other
        neighbors rather than from England alone.
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Germany</p>
      <p>
        Germany is a more natural ally for France. This is not because Germany
        has anything specific to offer France vis-à-vis England or the other
        powers, but rather because the design of the French-German border
        strongly discourages direct conflict between the two powers. Frontal
        assaults are prohibitively difficult because each country only needs
        three armies to defend the border. Both countries usually have three
        armies to defend the border after 1901. Without help from a third
        party, both countries must be content to guard the border and seek
        expansion elsewhere. That “expansion elsewhere” is a significant
        factor for Germany in working out its alliances, too. The prize of
        total dominion over Scandinavia is very tempting, and it brings
        Germany into direct conflict with England. That further incentivize
        French-German cooperation rather than conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        From France’s perspective, Germany is difficult to crack without
        either annexing or allying with England. Germany can only be beaten
        from the west via naval superiority. Relying on beating Germany with
        help from the east is risky, because that help will claim Berlin and
        Munich (making a win more difficult later in the game). Annexing
        England advances the goal of winning the game; allying with England
        permits England to grow to a point where France can no longer conquer
        England. Furthermore, Germany’s unique position directly on the major
        stalemate line leaves it constantly vulnerable to attacks from the
        east. These attacks become more likely as the game progresses. As
        noted, France doesn’t really want to see an all-out attack on Germany
        from a powerful Austria or Russia. But if those powers draw Germany’s
        attention east, that gives France the decisive window to strike and
        win.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a threat, Germany usually can’t overpower France through a frontal
        assault…but a crafty Germany can sneak into Burgundy if France isn’t
        diligent. Germany’s ability to threaten France increases sharply if
        Burgundy is breached. That said, it can still take time and good
        guesswork to convert such a breach into a permanent gain. The slight
        tactical advantage of being in Burgundy is almost never good enough
        for Germany to try to “go it alone” against France. Even if Germany
        can seize a positional advantage in Burgundy through diplomatic
        outmaneuvering, Germany needs help from another power to prevent
        France from recovering and repelling an incursion into Burgundy.
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Italy</p>
      <p>
        It might come as a surprise, after all this text about the importance
        of England and Germany, to read that Italy is the most threatening
        power to France early in the game. Again, as with England and Germany,
        it isn’t due to an ability to overpower France one-on-one; France can
        repel an Italian attack if France is not under duress from England or
        Germany. The chief issue is that France is almost always under duress
        from England or Germany. The Italian attack is comparatively rare in
        the early game, and almost always requires English or German
        encouragement.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it is a uniquely devastating attack because France is more
        vulnerable to southern attack than northern. Gulf of Lyons and Western
        Mediterranean are more threatening provinces to occupy than English
        Channel; and unlike with England and Germany, the units needed to
        defend against Italy and against any other neighbor overlap. Against
        England and Germany, France has a perfect division of labor: armies
        repel Germany, fleets repel England. France has the right mix of both
        types of units to get the job done. But Italy demands fleets and
        armies; Italy demands enough of them that France can’t hold off either
        of its other neighbors if they also attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news for France is that this Italian invasion is rare
        because, strategically speaking, France is Italy’s worst early target.
        England and Germany both want France’s centers as part of their solo
        win. Italy almost always comes into conflict with one or both powers
        shortly after conquering the southern French centers. Defending those
        gains can quickly become a quagmire where Italy totally stalls out to
        protect what it has, and can’t leverage its initial gains to create
        more gains, as it normally does when attacking Austria or Turkey.
        Attacking Austria poses a similar risk as attacking France, but the
        reward is much higher; attacking Turkey provides similar gains to
        attacking France, but with much lower risk of middle game predation.
        So usually, it’s enough for France to negotiate mutual nonaggression
        with Italy. But it’s still important to foster that relationship to
        avoid an embarrassing quick exit for the king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike England and Germany, Italy isn’t a particularly useful ally for
        France. Italy can’t attack England. And an Italian-French alliance
        against Germany is usually counterproductive for Italy; Italy can’t
        maintain any gains it makes in Germany, and any gains France makes in
        Germany will just make France more capable of attacking Italy in the
        middle game. Italy and France mutually understand that they may fight
        at some point (perhaps during the endgame solo run), but fighting
        early is usually mutually counterproductive. You’ll often see cordial
        nonaggression in public and to each other, mixed with
        behind-the-scenes scheming to slow the other down.
