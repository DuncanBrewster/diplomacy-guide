        Germany is located in central Europe and has easy access to two clusters
        of neutral SCs located in the Lowlands and Scandinavia. Germany has the
        potential to grow quickly because of this but shouldn't grow
        over-confident; Germany's central location makes it vulnerable to
        attacks from all sides, so it's wise to always remain in contact with
        all neighbors to protect against an enemy attack while German armies are
        away at the front.
      </p>
      <p>
        Germany can grow very quickly, and its central position makes crossing
        the stalemate line much easier than it is for a corner power. Victory
        for Germany can take many different forms, but will usually include at
        least its home SCs, Scandinavia (Swe, Nor, Den), the Lowlands (Bel,
        Hol), and at least two from any of England, France, Russia, or Austria.
        Even Iberia and Italy aren't out of the question either, and would then
        require fewer SCs be taken from the east or probably England.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though Germany's options are open, and it has the ability to achieve
        victory quickly, until it obtains a secure edge position it must always
        divide its attention to security and defense. Usually this will take the
        form of a strong alliance with Austria and sometimes Italy as well.
        Germany must be engaged in negotiations with its partner(s) to keep
        aggressive neighbors pinned down in battles so there are no wandering
        armies available to sneak into the German hinterlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Germany's attention through the first few years will primarily be taken
        up by the developments of the Western Triangle, comprising of itself,
        France, and England, and by the Northern Triangle of itself, England,
        and Russia. Germany can very easily take two builds for itself (Den and
        Hol), though it's also the only country who can support itself into Bel
        during the first year. Not only that, but from Den, it plays a deciding
        role in whether or not Russia captures Swe. Germany's actions can have
        wide-reaching effects from the very start, and it would be wise for
        Germany to leverage these situations together in its favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest questions to settle during the first year are the occupation
        of Bel, and if Russia should be allowed to capture Swe. Obviously,
        Germany should gauge the diplomatic stance of the Western Triangle
        before claiming Bel for itself, for even a Germany with six units will
        not last long against the combined forces of France and England.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swe, on the other hand, can be bartered off in exchange for Austria's
        security, or for help in defense against England should Germany find his
        negotiations to have failed within the Western Triangle. Denying Swe to
        Russia without reason, however, will only provoke another of Germany's
        neighbors into attacking and should not be done lightly.
