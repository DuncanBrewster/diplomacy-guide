      <p className="bodyHeadings">England</p>
      <p>
        To the northwest is England, who can quite easily maintain naval
        superiority over Germany. Any attack launched against England will
        require the help of either or both of France and Russia, and will allow
        Germany the security of reaching an edge of the board. Conversely,
        England and Germany can coordinate their efforts against both France and
        Russia, which could solidify their relations throughout a significant
        portion of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        In situations which Germany and England wish to eliminate France, it
        will usually entail a side-campaign against Russia simultaneously.
        Germany should press for three French SCs (two if Bel is German), as
        well as Den and Swe in the north, bringing Germany to 9 SCs. However,
        Germany shouldn't press his claim on Bel immediately, though if England
        had offered it as the price of an alliance, there is no reason to turn
        it down. Germany might also consider breaking through the French lines
        before France can arrange his defenses. Giving up a chance at a third
        build in the first year for an advanced position is a trade-off well
        worth the investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the east, Germany should push Italy and Austria to work together
        against Turkey and eventually against Russia. This will not only work to
        protect Germany's southeast from attack, but will also work to keep
        Russia and Turkey from moving west in strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tactically, Germany should bounce Russia out of Swe, and may consider a
        direct strike into Bur. If it succeeds, the army will be extremely
        difficult to pin down, and if forced to retreat, Gas is a prime
        location.
      </p>

      <p className="bodyHeadings">France</p>
      <p>
        France is located to the southwest, and is Germany's main rival on the
        continent in the west. France can block a German attack for years just
        by placing armies in Pic/Bur, bogging down any fight along that front
        unless help comes from Italy or England. If allied, however, France and
        Germany can cooperate in removing England, giving both nations a
        heightened sense of security, allowing them to then turn east and push
        past the stalemate line in strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should Germany and France wish to eliminate England, Germany should
        claim two of England's SCs, and this situation is also the easiest for
        Germany to justify taking Bel in the first year. After England is
        eliminated, Germany has a strong northern position capable of kicking
        Russia out of Swe. Naval power is incredibly important in this scenario,
        not only to break the English blockade, but also as a defensive force
        against France once the spoils have been divided. It'd be wise for
        Germany to build a fleet in each year as available until a decent navy
        has been constructed. Also, since Germany will have control of at least
        4 SCs bordering on NTH, he should work to justify leaving a fleet there
        and in NWG to solidify the defensive strength found on the north edge of
        the board.
      </p>
      <p>
        To his neighbors, Germany should again defend Austria in his
        negotiations and use this leverage to tie up a slow, indecisive war in
        the southeast. Russia should be appeased with the gift of Swe,
        potentially in exchange for assistance in removing the English from Nwy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tactically, Germany should push hard to keep the English from landing in
        Bel and coordinate with Russia to make sure any English foothold in Nwy
        is constantly under threat.
      </p>

      <p className="bodyHeadings">Russia</p>
      <p>
        To the east lies Russia, who is the only neighbor capable of immediately
        crippling Germany from the start. Fortunately, Russia's attention is
        usually focused on the south, leaving Scandinavia as the only real point
        of contention between itself and Germany. A wary eye must always watch
        Russia, for a quick strike into Sil can cause major disruptions in
        Germany's plans and defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attacking Russia is open regardless of who Germany's early game ally
        was, though it's notably easier if England is still around to lend a
        hand in the far north. It's also important to note whether or not Russia
        has had success in the early game, for if one of the eastern powers is
        already eliminated, Russia will soon start its westward march and
        Germany will need to face this threat head on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully, Austria will be sitting on about 5 SCs, drawing Russia into a
        slow fruitless battle in the east. Germany's first gains against Russia
        will probably come from Scandinavia, and must work to push past Swe to
        threaten StP while at the same time defending the sensitive BAL from
        Russian fleets. Farther south, sending an army into Sil to assault War
        will not only hit a sensitive end of Russia's likely front line, but
        also prevent a Russian army from getting there first and threatening
        both Mun and Ber.
      </p>
      <p>
        Germany should work hard to negotiate a DMZ of NTH or take it for
        himself, depending on which western power is left on the board, since
        this will free up many units from needing to defend the many coastal SCs
        that will likely be under German control. On the Russian front, Germany
        should be vigilant for any opportunity to outmaneuver the defending
        forces. Getting an army to slip into Lvn, Gal, or Ukr can cause major
        headaches for Russia and quickly crumble any defensive position that may
        have been built.
      </p>
      

      <p className="bodyHeadings">Italy and Austria</p>
      <p>
        In the south are Italy and Austria, the other two central powers of
        Diplomacy. Most commonly, Germany asserts a position of benign neglect
        among the central powers, since they do not have the luxury of an edge
        position and must use each other to provide a rear defense. It's not
        uncommon for Germany or Italy to send an army into Tyr to assert
        dominance over the negotiations of these three nations, either in a
        peacekeeping role or to attack anyone who steps out of line of the best
        interests of the central triangle.
