        Germany has almost as much flexibility as France, but is not in as
        safe a position. Depending on the opening strategy, Germany is either
        guaranteed Denmark or Holland, and usually has a finger in the debate
        over Belgium.

      <p>
        Germany's main choice is where to put their fleetâ€”moving the fleet to
        Denmark provides leverage against Russia, but moving the fleet to
        Holland gives a better shot at three builds.
