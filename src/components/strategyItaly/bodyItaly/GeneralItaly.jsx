        Italy is often considered as one of the weaker countries because it has
        minimal access to neutral supply centers; it can only reach Serbia,
        Greece, and Tunisia in the first year, it must choose between the latter
        two, and the first one is not only Austria's only guaranteed center but
        it also requires Austria to give that center up. Italy cannot get off to
        a rapid start without attacking its neighbors in 1901. Fortunately for
        Italy, it can often be the catalyst of a massive invasion of any one of
        those neighbors, and in the short term often profits from three such
        invasions (Germany being the only one in which Italy is likely to get
        the short end of the stick right off the bat.) Italy's second problem,
        though, is that in the long term it often gets picked off after
        catalyzing the invasions, because it never manages to consolidate its
        position diplomatically, tactically and strategically, and its former
        friends decide to continue expansion without it.

        The primary challenge to Italian supremacy, then, is the difficulty
        involved in making allies for the long term; it takes a player of sound
        tactical skill, honed persuasive abilities, and keen strategic vision to
        excel as Italy, even moreso than the other powers. Most Diplomacy
        players fail to conduct the nuanced diplomacy needed to secure allies
        for the long term, or fail to see the strategic picture correctly, or
        otherwise flop in tactics during the opening round of invasions and fail
        to make any substantial progress in the first place, and so Italy has
        developed a reputation for weakness. For a player with all of the
        talents needed to excel, however, the Italian position is one of the
        best in the game: extremely easy to defend by land, available oceans for
        the kind of naval supremacy any winning power (not named Austria) must
        develop, home centers placed near several stalemate lines for quick
        reinforcement (on defense) or sudden breaches (on offense), and several
        small knots of easily-defended centers which can be seized in the
        initial strike and converted to a strong power base through the middle
        and end games (southern Balkans, Turkey, Iberia). The trick is to get
        the alliances needed to seize one or more of these knots in the
        beginning and then maintain the alliances needed to secure them until
        Italy is ready for a winning push.
