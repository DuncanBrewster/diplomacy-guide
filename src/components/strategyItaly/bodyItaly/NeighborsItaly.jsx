        Italy can open against any four of its neighbors, though which neighbors
        can be targeted first can also be narrowed down without much trouble.
        Germany is highly impractical as the only efficient means of accessing
        the country is through its home center in Munich; ignoring Munich, it
        takes the Italian armies two years to get in position to take Berlin,
        and Munich is nearly impossible to hold from the south, let alone
        converted to a strong base of operations. The remaining three neighbors
        are more reasonable options for the initial strike: Austria can be hit
        through the Tyrolean corridor or surprised with convoys into the
        southern Balkan region, Turkey can be hit with a Lepanto opening, and
        Italy can often profit from an Anglo-German-spearheaded assault on
        France.

      <p className="bodyHeadings">Austria</p>
      <p>
        Austria lies directly to the east, and the Ven/Tri boundary is the only
        instance of home SCs of neighboring powers bordering directly. Such a
        volatile and unique situation deserves ample discussion in and of
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The diplomatic stance of these two are usually along one of two
        extremes: Italy diving into the Austrian heartland immediately and
        incessantly, or coordinating their efforts in a manner nearly unseen by
        any other pair of nations. Which of these approaches is taken is
        entirely in Italy's control, as Austria cannot realistically attack
        Italy without being himself swallowed up by Russia and Turkey, while
        Italy faces no such danger from France should he wish to initiate
        hostilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this relationship can have effects across the board, and since
        Italy is in the dominant position of this relationship, he can expect a
        number of messages inquiring about his intentions and shouldn't shy away
        from extorting bribes in exchange to ensure the elimination or security
        of Austria in the early game. While this wheeling and dealing may give
        Italy a diplomatic advantage, there is one major factor Italy must keep
        in mind before making his decision: the Russia-Turkey relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Russia and Turkey are hostile, Italy has little to fear from an
        immediate strike against Austria. The Russian and Turkish forces may not
        chance creating a weak spot in their lines to take part in the partition
        of Austria, hopefully leaving the bulk of the Balkan peninsula free for
        capture by Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, should Russia and Turkey be friendly to each other, they will
        be more than happy to take their share of the Austrian SCs, and with
        that momentum can overrun a 6 SC Italy without too much trouble. In this
        case, not only should Italy assist in the defense of Austria out of
        self-preservation, but can leverage this to diplomatically enlarge his
        share of the eastern and/or Balkan SCs following the elimination of
        Turkey.
      </p>

      <p className="bodyHeadings">Turkey</p>
      <p>
        Far to the east awaits Turkey, usually Italy's main rival for control of
        the Mediterranean waters. Novice players may think the location of
        Austria makes Italy and Turkey too distant for early aggression, but
        thanks to the infamous Lepanto opening (discussed later on), these two
        can find themselves locked in battle from the second year onward.
      </p>
      <p>
        An attack against Turkey, though not immediately apparent, can be an
        effective method of growth while simultaneously taking easily-defended
        SCs in a corner of the board. The Lepanto Opening (maybe the most
        notorious opening system in Diplomacy) is achieved by convoying an army
        to Tun in the first year, and following with a convoy into Syr or Smy in
        the second. This way Italy can very quickly project much of its strength
        far from home, concentrated on a narrow front on Turkey's south. Italy
        should take no less than two of Turkey's SCs, despite any Russian or
        Austrian claims otherwise, and can often take all three for himself
        before either of Turkey's neighbors can take advantage of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Austria should be courted for assistance in such an attack, and since
        France is almost invariably focused on the west, defense of the Italian
        homeland can easily be accomplished by the lone army left behind.
        Oftentimes, the home front is so quiet that Italy can send this guard
        army off on an expedition to steal Mar if France is falling quickly, or
        move into a forward position against Russia to help keep Austria in
        fighting shape until the defeat of Turkey. 
      </p>

      <p className="bodyHeadings">France</p>
      <p>
        In the west sits France who, though owns a southern port, begins with
        its lone fleet well out of harm's way through the first few seasons. The
        land border between them is the narrow Mar/Pie corridor, and an army
        placed there by either side will hold out indefinitely against the other
        unless naval support is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every once in a while, Italy will be provided an opportunity to strike
        west without losing an opportunity to make easy gains in the east
        afterward. In an attack against France, Italy should claim both Mar and
        Spa. Hopefully this will allow Italy to also take Por without making a
        formal arrangement of its ownership with England. Many times, Italy will
        choose to order units straight into Pie and TYS, fully alerting France
        to his intentions. France can easily defend against Italy, instead
        awarding most of the French SCs to England and Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        Care must be taken that France is engaged with the other western powers
        before Italy commits to the attack. An army in Pie can still be useful,
        however, for if France is forced to cover Mar in the fall, Pie can
        support Spa-Mar to prevent France from standing himself off. This not
        only deprives France the chance to build a southern fleet after the
        first year, but will also deny him a build from Spa. Should this
        situation not appear, Pie can quietly retreat to Ven or Tyr to cast
        doubt on Italy's intentions until the offensive is taken.
