      <p>
        Russia begins the game with a psychological disadvantage. It not only
        starts with one more unit than any of the other Great Powers, but the
        amount of real-estate it takes up on the map makes Russia look dangerous
        to the others; - a serious diplomatic disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make matters worse, your initial position is quite precarious. Russia
        can't even be sure of a build in year one, since Germany and Austria can
        easily deny you the obvious neutrals of Sweden and Rumania. You also
        face an immediate point of conflict with Turkey over control of the
        Black Sea. (No prizes for guessing the object of Turkish diplomacy)
      </p>
      <p>
        Russian diplomacy should be targeted to ensure at least one build in the
        first year. One build will ensure you remain a viable contender. Two
        builds will give you the momentum to become a major contender.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, you should find it easy to negotiate a deal with Germany.
        Germany will be looking for growth in the Low countries and Denmark.
        They'll have enough problems there without looking to open a front with
        you. They should be amenable to a DMZ over Silesia in return for
        providing unopposed access for the St Petersburg fleet into Sweden.
      </p>
      <p>
        The South is make or break territory for Russia. A situation which calls
        for real diplomatic effort. Austria is well aware of the threat you
        pose, but they are equally aware of the Turkish threat. Austria will
        want to ally with Italy, but Turkey will be actively trying to enlist
        Italy as an ally against Austria. Italy may also prove to be a useful
        ally to you. Russia-Italy is quite a powerful combination in the middle
        game, so don't burn any bridges with them unless you have to. Just stay
        focussed. In turn one you want Rumania.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turkey will also be talking to you. Ultimately you won't be able to
        prevent them acquiring the Black Sea. You don't want them to have it in
        Spring 01 because that gives them leverage on Rumania, but at the same
        time, you don't want a full-on Turkish attack via Armenia as well. It
        may be possible to negotiate a deal, and maybe even an alliance with
        Turkey, but be very careful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great thing about Russia's Southern front is that you have the
        potential for deals with Italy, Austria and Turkey. They may all be
        potential foes, but rarely do they work together. There is always an odd
        one out - someone for you to do business with.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to win, you will eventually need the lode of supply centres
        controlled by either Austria or Turkey. (They need your centres for the
        same reason). Such problems are for the future. You've yet to survive
        year one.
      </p>
      <p>
        How you play the middle game will depend, but try to play to your
        strengths. Russia is primarily an army based power. In the South, Russia
        rarely becomes a major naval power. It takes too long for fleets to get
        into the Med.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's true that she can become a naval power in the North, and fleets
        from St Petersburg have been decisive in corroding the standard naval
        stalemate lines formed around the MAO and Spain, but unless specific
        tactical situations require it, put the bulk of your effort into armies.
