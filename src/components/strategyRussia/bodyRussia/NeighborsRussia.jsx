        The most outstanding advantage of the Russian power in the South is that
        both Austria and Turkey will want to ally with Russia. A
        Turkish/Austrian alliance, though not impossible, is usually highly
        unlikely (we've never seen one survive past the early years).
      </p>
      <p>
        Russia's typical course of action is to maintain at least an initial
        surface friendliness with Turkey. It is, after all, necessary for
        Austria to prove a capable player. No Russia should ever ally with an
        Austria which does not appear able to conduct a strategically sound war.
        You are better off allying with Turkey and looking to sharing the easy
        spoils.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other possibility is allying with Austria. This can be very
        rewarding in the short and medium term (if only by default). For
        example, if Austria is looking strong defensively and the prospects for
        a successful ground attack look poor, the Russian Czar may be 'forced'
        to be friendly. No matter, a forced alliance is as good as any other. In
        our opinion, the early R/A alliance is as good as its players, but far
        more powerful than R/T in the mid-game and endgame situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sheer numbers of a R/A alliance after Fall 1901 means that Turkey
        will inevitably crumble. The Black Sea offensive described above will
        make impossible any Turk dreams of expanding beyond Bul. The naval
        forces should be balanced (2 Turk fleets vs. 1 Russian + 1 Austrian
        fleet) but the R/A armies will both outnumber and outflank the 2 Turk
        armies many times.

        At game start, England's safest bet for a build is Norway. You have the
        power to frustrate that by moving Mos-Stp, then Stp-Nor for a stand-off.
        You don't really want to do this, because it will leave the South too
        vulnerable, but it is a useful negotiating tool. Wouldn't England prefer
        a peaceful demarcation of the Scandinavian territories? Try to get them
        to agree to take Norway with a fleet.
      </p>
      <p>
        It lowers their potential for offensive action later. With England, you
        are trying to attain some stability in the North, so you can free up
        resources in the South.
      </p>

        Alternatively, you could enter the Top-of-the-World Sweep alliance. With
        Russia and England both at the "top of the world", you can sweep
        downwards without stop, crushing Germany, Austria-Hungary, France and
        sometimes Italy and Turkey. Russia advancing into Germany,
        Austria-Hungary, and sometimes Turkey, claims the Eastern world. England
        can make its way down the coast and into France, completely dominating
        if it can get its navies into the water fast enough. And once it has
        claimed France, Italy will be the next to easily go, since it will
        generally be attacked by Austria-Hungary and France at the beginning of
        the game. But here's where the hard part comes in. You and England both
        border Germany, which is a key spot in attacking both Austria-Hungary
        and France. Also, these are both big countries, and though they are
        supporting each other, it can get tricky and tensions can get high if
        Turkey decides to attack you. England can't do anything. And if France
        attacks England and is winning, you really can't help at all either
        since it would have to cross English territory and therefore make a
        seemingly aggressive attack on England. Overall, this is a great
        alliance if the two of you can pull it off properly. If not, you and
        England will most likely fight each other to the death.

        The fact that Germany often looks to Russia for the second tranche of
        supply centres once the Western triangle is settled is quite logical
        when you consider the proximity of the Russian centres, the fact that
        Germany is essentially a land-based power, and the influence of
        Switzerland and the stalemate lines on geography. In particular, in
        order to win the game without crossing the stalemate line Germany needs
        two or three Russian home centres to stand any chance of victory.
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course the converse also applies. Russia needs to secure her
        frontiers in the early game and will be looking for assistance from
        neighbors to get a foothold in the Balkans or Scandinavia. This is
        certain to bring her into conflict with either Austria and/or Turkey in
        the south and with either England and/or Germany in the north. If Russia
        strikes a good deal in the Balkans and makes early gains, then it is
        likely that in the short term Russia will keep sending armies
        southwards. But once Russia has got as far as she can easily get
        (usually the Vie/Bud line) or as far as she has agreed with her ally,
        where else can Russia seek growth? It has to be in Scandinavia and
        Germany. By this time either Germany will have let Russia into
        Scandinavia, there will be an uneasy balance in the area or England will
        have monopolized the situation, perhaps even taking StP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual Russian game plan in the north would be to take Scandinavia,
        the North Sea and maybe the odd English centre while eliminating Germany
        through encirclement. And of course if Germany assists Russia in taking
        Scandinavia he is just speeding up the process. A continued Russian
        presence in Scandinavia coupled with Russian success in the Balkans
        will, in my opinion, inevitably lead to a Russian attack on Germany.
        Indeed, if you consider where Russia is to get 18 centres from, you have
        Mos, StP, War, Sev, Con, Ank, Smy, Rum, Bul, Gre, Vie, Bud, Tri, Ven,
        Swe and Nwy for 16. To win Russia must take mainland Italy (difficult
        without a large naval presence), take England (possible with German
        help, but Russia can't build fleets that fast) or take Germany. Of these
        three options, Germany is the easiest, especially with help from Russian
        units in Scandinavia and Austria. Of course, if Turkey is still in the
        game, then the need to take the German centres for a victory becomes
        overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what does this all mean for Russia? I believe that the mid-game
        interests of Germany and Russia in Diplomacy are almost always
        incompatible and that for real and lasting success one must take the
        home centres of the other. Therefore, that Power which is first able to
        mount such an attack effectively will have a decisive advantage and that
        early strategy for both Powers should be directed at putting themselves
        into that position.

        In the early moves, a Russo-Turkish alliance has a lot going for it. A
        swift deal over the Balkans can be combined with a crushing attack on
        Austria. In the first view moves Russian gains are likely to be solid
        which can release builds for use in the north. Eventually Russia
        normally does better out of Juggernauts (Russian-Turkish Alliance) than
        Turkey, especially when the knife is slipped between Turkey’s shoulder
        blades. If the alliance with Turkey is retained to the end of the game,
        then it is likely that Russia would have to reach England and the Low
        Countries before it would be possible to make 18 centres. But if Turkey
        is taken, then Venice and Berlin will be sufficient. If Russia were to
        make a massive break out in the north, getting in to the North Sea, then
        it is feasible to win without taking on Turkey at all - but such an
        outcome is unlikely. The sad truth is that Juggernauts usually come to
        grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing all commentators seem to agree on is that it is bad news for
        Russia to let Turkey into BLA in S01. That would tend to suggest that if
        Russia has any doubts about Turkish intentions then she should cover BLA
        (and remember that 70% of all Turks order to BLA in S01, while only 53%
        of Russians do likewise).
      </p>
      <p>
        The all-out Turkish attack is F(Sev)-BLA, A(Mos)-Sev, A(War)-Ukr, and if
        the move to BLA succeeds, it can be a strong set of moves. On the other
        hand, if the move to BLA fails, then Russia may not get a build in the
        south if Austria and Turkey combine in A01. That is why Richard Sharp
        has said “…reserve this one for the occasions when you are at least 90%
        that Turkey is an idiot, and when you are also reasonably confident that
        Austria will come in on your side.”
