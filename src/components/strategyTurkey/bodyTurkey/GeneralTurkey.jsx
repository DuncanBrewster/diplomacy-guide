        If someone prefers tactics over strategy, likes high stakes gambling,
        and is more interested in an early 10 than a late 18 dots, they do not
        have what it takes to play Turkey. You need 18 dots to win and to my
        knowledge no Turkey ever captured them without sailing into the Western
        Mediterranean. So just like any good sailor, you should concentrate on
        the horizon - think about strategies that get you past Sicily. The
        problem is, sailing West usually necessitates eliminating Italy and your
        Italian fellow knows just as much about Diplomacy as you do. You should
        not take anything for granted in Diplomacy. Let us reconsider stalemate
        lines. Other stalemate lines to watch are the Strait of Gibraltar, the
        Alps south of Munich and the surroundings of St. Petersburg. Jointly
        they form the key stalemate line dividing the board into seventeen
        Northwestern dots (including Spa, Mar and StP) and seventeen
        Southeastern dots (including Warsaw). You need to pass this line
        somewhere in order to win. Not focusing upon that fact during every
        single turn of the game, while writing every single letter you send, and
        when deciding every move, retreat and build will be the main cause of
        failure. Your home centers are far from the stalemate lines and Turkey's
        traditional slow start does not help in getting to or even passing
        through these barriers. Yet, if you succeed, you will be assured of
        victory. You will need fleets, fleets, fleets to rule the Mediterranean
        (*that* every Sultan seems to see) but unless you decide on the
        "Steamroller", you also need armies, armies, armies. Look at your two
        closest neighbors. Austria and Russia. Both are land-locked countries
        and to capture all of their dots, fleets don't help. Ruling the waves
        does not gain 18 dots and stalling you in the Ionian Sea is easier than
        resisting a combined land-sea attack by our mighty forces. This is a
        matter of balancing your powers wisely. The only problem with armies is
        that Bulgaria is a bottleneck for expansion to the Balkan, and unless
        you have a fleet in BLA, your expansionist plans will be frustrated more
        than once. Now, let us enter the war room, and review some dangerous
        knives pointed at the heart of our nation.
