        The most common threat to Turkey is a Russian fleet in the tranquil
        Black Sea. It constantly puts two of your supply centers at risk. Yet,
        arranging a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in BLA is like praying for rain -
        it fails when you need it. Combined with a Russian A Arm, F BLA grows
        from a nuisance to a deadly noose. If Austria or Italy join Russia, you
        are history in the making. Thus it is important to keep Russia out of
        Armenia. There are three ways to achieve that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is to move there yourself. This is commonly achieved in the
        "Russian Attack" (F Ank-BLA, A Smy-Arm) to which we will come back in
        the "Opening Moves". A word of advice - gaining Sev in 1901 is a rare
        outcome and the main effect of this opening is to raise Austria's price
        for cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second way to keep Russia out of Armenia is a stand-off F Sev-BLA, F
        Ank-BLA. In Spring 1901, that is a common arrangement between our two
        nations, but it works just as well later. Yet, in the Fall 1901 Russia
        will want to use F Sev to take Rum and afterwards few Russians are
        willing to bind their units in a DMZ arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third way to keep Russia out of Armenia is to make him your ally.
        That is the most dreaded alliance on the board and is commonly called
        "Juggernaut" or "Steamroller." Russia rolls through continental Europe
        while Turkey rules the Mediterranean coasts. Once established, that
        alliance is almost impossible to stop and if you and the Russian have
        agreed upon it, your foremost goal should be to keep it secret as long
        as possible. The Spring, 1901 standoff over BLA is too common a feature
        to trick anyone, thus you need at least a Turkish move to BLA in the
        fall to camouflage your plans. In its purest form, the alliance will
        result in a "lease" of A Con to Russia while Russia orders F Sev exactly
        the way you want him to. This often fails because it is difficult to
        channel the Russian F Sev through Con into the Med without inviting a
        stab. A pure "Steamroller" starts with A War-Gal, A Mos-Sev, F Sev-BLA,
        A Con-Bul, F Ank-Con, A Smy-Ank in Spring, 1901 and A Sev S A Bul-Rum, F
        BLA-Con and F Con-Bul (sc) in Fall, 1901 but these moves are far too
        obvious and risky to be recommendable. Thus Turkey and Russia usually
        suffice with bouncing F Sev-BLA and F Ank-BLA and retreating the Russian
        fleet off the board at the first possible moment. Even a perfect
        "Steamroller" creates just one little problem for Turkey. It benefits
        Russia more than Turkey. A smart Russia will know this and will hand you
        dots in the Balkan to keep the two of you at par during your slow crawl
        through the Med. However, greed tempts most Russians, and unless second
        place is your goal, they must be stabbed eventually. The only
        alternative is to slow Russia's expansion down by cooperating with her
        enemies, which brings me to our next issue: Strategic Alliances.
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Austria</p>
      <p>
        Among your closer neighbors, a Steamroller with Russia is promising but
        may be too obvious while any alliance with Austria suffers from the
        potential two-way battle against Italy and Russia. There have been many
        heated debates among our nation's wisest generals whether an alliance
        with Russia or with Austria is more successful. In a "Steamroller,"
        Turkey is the junior partner and usually ends in second place. With
        Austria it is just the opposite. Turkey tends to be the stronger nation
        and the one much better suited to stab his ally. That sounds like A-T is
        preferable but A-R is a forceful alliance while A-T is often countered
        by an Italian alliance with Russia. Both are viable options but in the
        end it will come down to your judgment.
      </p>
      <p className="bodyHeadings">Italy</p>
      <p>
        Italy is the only neighboring power that is an unlikely choice as your
        ally. Both of you need to rule the Mediterranean to prosper and both of
        you know that you will eventually clash. Italy is a good test of your
        skills as a diplomat. Offer him nothing, but make him think you are
        giving him the sun, moon and stars. A discussion of
        alliances would not be complete without the coalitions that are
        potentially harmful to you: A-R and A-I are both dangerous and common,
        but thanks to your board position, they will need a lot of time and
        patience to pry you out of the corner. Furthermore, few of these
        alliances work well over the long run and you should take every
        opportunity to drive a wedge between them.
