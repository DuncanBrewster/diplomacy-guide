                Diplomatically neutral, this is the most popular German opening,
                gives him a shot at three builds, and focuses on the main point
                of contention for the West in 1901â€”the Low Countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recommended opening to every German player, since Denmark is
                always guaranteed for Germany (lest Fleet Kiel should slack off
                and do not move, allowing an English Fleet North Sea able to
                take over). This also opens Germany's way into Scandanavia, over
                which it may have to fight with England and Russia.
