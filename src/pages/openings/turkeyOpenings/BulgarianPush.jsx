                Turkey's best shot at two builds in 1901 is a push through BUL,
                followed by either a move to GRE or SER, or RUM with Austrian
                support. Although Turkey rarely gets two buildsâ€”most Austrians
                move to ALB and SER in S 1901, and thus can pick up both SCs,
                and are wary of giving support to Turkey, Austria's natural
                enemy, the opening is safe and allows Turkey to work with or
                against any of his neighbors.
